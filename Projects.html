          <ul>
            <li>Here I've created a function named calculate() that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.</li>
            <li>If a list containing less than 9 elements is passed into the function, it will raise a ValueError exception with the message: "List must contain nine numbers." The values in the returned dictionary are lists and not Numpy arrays.</li>

          <ul>There was a dataset of demographic data given, that was extracted from the 1994 Census database. In this project, I found out certain results for the conclusion:
            <li>How many people of each race are represented in this dataset?</li>
            <li>What is the average age of men?</li>
            <li>What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?</li>
            <li>What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?</li>
            <li>What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?</li>
            <li>What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?</li>
            <li>What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?</li>
            <li>What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?</li>
            <li>Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.</li>

            <li>Also working with models, we narrowed down our favored modeling algorithms to Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors.</li>
